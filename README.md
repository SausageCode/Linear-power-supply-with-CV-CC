# Linear-power-supply-with-CC-CV

 Self made Linear power supply based on ThePostApocalypticInventor's work. Details in schematic and readme.
  
I made this schematic based on The Post Apocalyptic Inventor's work, that you can find in his chanel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDbWmfrwmzn1ZsGgrYRUxoA

This power supply design has been rewritten, tested and built by me and in the future, there will be pictures and videos of the finished project.

The power supply is very simple to make and to understand, so for any questions you can visit his video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFIovMkRyg) describing all parts of the power supply. Feel free to ask him or me for advice.

Also this project involves mains power and mishandling of it can be fatal so make sure that you know that are you doing, buy premade mains components, such as the transformer and mains input with **fuse**.
## Warning
 **I am not responsible for any damage to your equipment or your health so study the circuit, and if you work with wiring your own mains part, make sure that you know what you are doing and so at your own risk.**
  
  Happy making! :P
